Release Notes, March 11, 2021


The ConMod2.exe program needs a Windows computer to run.

To run the Concept Modeler (ConMod) program, please download the folder named: “ConMod_Download” and unzip the contents into a convenient location.

Then double click on ConMod2.exe.

The program may not work on your computer if you are missing the mfc140u.dll file.  In that case, copy that file from another Windows PC or copy the file provided within the download folder.  Then paste the file into the C:\Windows\System32 folder and try running the program again.

You will need a text file formatted to encode a finite state automata for the device you are modeling.  For this purpose, four sample text files are provided.

You can also refer to the video tutorial for a live demonstration and user instructions.

The source code of ConMod is written in Visual C++ on the MFC platform.  The source code is available upon request.  Please email Dr. C. Sen at csen@fit.edu.
