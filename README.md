# ConMod

This repository contains the Concept Modeler program designed for modeling engineering systems in terms of their technical functions and performing model-based reasoning on those models.  We included the source code in Visual C++ (Visual Studio 2018 or later) that can be downloaded and compiled.  We also include the program as a single executable file (ConMod2.exe).
